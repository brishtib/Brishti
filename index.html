                             <p>Hello Jane Doe,

                             I recently came across the new website that XYZ Company built for City Services.
                             I was so impressed by its design and functionality. 
                             My background in front-end development and user interfaces
                             would make me a great fit for the UX Designer position at XYZ Company.
                            
                             I am a passionate Designer with experience in wireframing,
                             UI patterns, and user flows. For the past year, 
                             I have worked as a UX Designer at Design Company. 
                             I helped develop tools such as a customizable management system and a new web portal.
                            
                            I was a key member of the team that developed an app to connect consumers,
                             which was awarded Best Design at the 2020 Design Awards.</p>
